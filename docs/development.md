# How to start development

## Install please tools

- For managing the Python, PyTorch, and other libraries environment, you can install Anaconda: https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows

- For working with Pytorch code, you can install Visual Studio Code from this link: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

- For downloading the code from Github, you can install SourceTree from this link: https://www.sourcetreeapp.com

## SourceTree
Download code from GitHub

Pull the code to make sure the code we are looking at is always the latest. Because sometimes other people will upload new code to this repo and we want to use their new code too, so make sure you pull everytime you start SourceTree

Try changing something in the code, I will add the line `This is a test commit` in `run.py`
